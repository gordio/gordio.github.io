Once you are happy with your document, you can publish it on different websites directly from StackEdit. As for now, StackEdit can publish on **Blogger**, **Dropbox**, **Gist**, **GitHub**, **Google Drive**, **Tumblr**, **WordPress** and on any SSH server.

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc}

You can insert a table of contents using the marker `{:toc}`:

1. TOC
{:toc}

#### <i class="icon-upload"></i> Publish a document

You can publish your document by opening the <i class="icon-upload"></i> **Publish** sub-menu and by choosing a website. In the dialog box, you can choose the publication format:

- Markdown, to publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (**GitHub** for instance),
- HTML, to publish the document converted into HTML (on a blog for example),
- Template, to have a full control of the output.

> **Note:** The default template is a simple webpage wrapping your document in HTML format. You can customize it in the **Advanced** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

#### <i class="icon-upload"></i> Update a publication

After publishing, StackEdit will keep your document linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to update it. Once you have modified your document and you want to update your publication, click on the <i class="icon-upload"></i> button in the navigation bar.

> **Note:** The <i class="icon-upload"></i> button is disabled when your document has not been published yet.

#### <i class="icon-upload"></i> Manage document publication

Since one document can be published on multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking <i class="icon-upload"></i> **Manage publication** in the <i class="icon-provider-stackedit"></i> menu panel. This will let you remove publication locations that are associated to your document.

> **Note:** If the file has been removed from the website or the blog, the document will no longer be published on that location.

Markdown Extra
--------------------

StackEdit supports **Markdown Extra**, which extends **Markdown** syntax with some nice features.

```

class Perceptron(object):
    """
        The first parameter, `learn_speed`, is used to control how fast our
        perceptron will learn. The lower the value, the longer it will take to
        learn, but the less one value will change each overall weight. If this
        parameter is too high, our program will change its weights so quickly
        that they are inaccurate. On the other hand, if `learn_speed` is too
        low, it will take forever to train the perceptron accurately. A good
        value for this parameter is about 0.01-0.05.

        The second parameter, `num_weights`, controls how many weights the
        perceptron will have. Our perceptron will also have the same number of
        inputs as it does weights, because each input has its own weight.
    """

    def __init__(self, num_weights, learn_speed=0.05):
        super(Perceptron, self).__init__()
        self.speed = learn_speed
        self.weights = []

> **Tip:** You can disable any **Markdown Extra** feature in the **Extensions** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.
>
> **Note:** You can find more information about **Markdown** syntax [here][2] and **Markdown Extra** extension [here][3].


### Lists

 - List one
^
 - List two

### Tables

**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for tables:

Item     | Value | Jinx
-------- | ---   | ---
Computer | $1600 | aksdjlkajsdlkajsdlkjsalkdjasd
Phone    | $12   | a
Pipe     | $1    | -

You can specify column alignment with one or two colons:

| Item     | Value | Qty   |
| :------- | ----: | :---: |
| Computer | $1600 |  5    |
| Phone    | $12   |  12   |
| Pipe     | $1    |  234  |


### Definition Lists

**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for definition lists too:

Term 1
Term 2
:   Definition A
:   Definition B

Term 3

:   Definition C

:   Definition D

    > part of definition D


### Fenced code blocks

GitHub's fenced code blocks are also supported with **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting:

```
// Foo
var bar = 0;
```

> **Tip:** To use **Prettify** instead of **Highlight.js**, just configure the **Markdown Extra** extension in the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

> **Note:** You can find more information:

> - about **Prettify** syntax highlighting [here][5],
> - about **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting [here][6].


### Footnotes

You can create footnotes like this[^footnote].

[^footnote]: Here is the *text* of the **footnote**.


### SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                  | ASCII                        | HTML              |
 ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------
| Single backticks | `'Isn't this fun?'`            | 'Isn't this fun?' |
| Quotes           | `"Isn't this fun?"`            | "Isn't this fun?" |
| Dashes           | `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash` | -- is en-dash, --- is em-dash |


### Table of contents
{: .no_toc}

You can insert a table of contents using the marker `{:toc}`:

1. TOC
{:toc}


### MathJax

You can render *LaTeX* mathematical expressions using **MathJax**, as on [math.stackexchange.com][1]:

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

> **Tip:** To make sure mathematical expressions are rendered properly on your website, include **MathJax** into your template:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>
```

> **Note:** You can find more information about **LaTeX** mathematical expressions [here][4].


### UML diagrams

You can also render sequence diagrams like this:

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```

And flow charts like this:

```flow
st=>start: Start
e=>end
op=>operation: My Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
```

> **Note:** You can find more information:

> - about **Flow charts** syntax [here][8].
